My Mongodb project topic is Energy_Consumption_Monitoring, I have named the screenshoots taken in sequence, for example step 1, step 2, if some step have three or more screenshots, I have named them for example, step 3a, step 3b, step 3c and so on. I am going to explain my project step by step that what I have done so far and what was my understanding.
Step 1. I generally utilized 'use' command to create database.
Step 2. Used command to create 5 collections in accordance to my topic Energy_Consumption_Monitoring with collection name as EnergyConsumption, Equipment, EnergyCost, EnvironmentalImpact and Processes.
Step 3. I used 'insertOne()' command to insert a single document into a collection. 
Step 4. I used the 'insertMany()' command to insert multiple documents into a collection in a single operation. 
Step 5. Imported 10 record within a collection, with the help of cmd, by setting up environment variable path to mongoimport command line tools.
Step 6. Populated other 4 collection, with records.
Step 7. I updated the EnergyConsumption collection, using updateOne command.
Step 8. In this step I used, updateMany command, where i updated all collection with multiple documents. Step 9 is also part of this step
Step 10. In this step I read one document from the energy consumption collection.
Step 11. Now in this step I read multiple documents from the EnergyCost Collection.
Step 12. Deleted one document from EnergyConsumption
Step 13. Deleted many document from the EnergyCost Collection
Step 14. Created Excel File to not down the workload, running different queries, and there execution stats.
Step 15. Created index that I noted down in the workload excel file.
Step 16. In this step I checked the execution stats.
Step 17. In this step, implementation of 7 mongodb aggregation functions.
Step 18. In the last step,  3 different aggregation pipelines was done. 

I have submitted the Screenshot, Excel folder, and this readme.md file on github.
